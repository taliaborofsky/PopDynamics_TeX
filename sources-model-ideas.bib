In recent years, social information has been proposed to profoundly affect the dynamics of populations and facilitate the coexistence of interacting species.

Moreover, it also decreased the strength of the negative feedback of second-order dependence between predator and prey.

	Abstract = {Abstract
            
              Social transmission of information is taxonomically widespread and could have profound effects on the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of animal communities. Demonstrating this in the wild, however, has been challenging. Here we show by field experiment that social transmission among predators can shape how selection acts on prey defences. Using artificial prey and a novel approach in statistical analyses of social networks, we find that blue tit (
              Cyanistes caeruleus
              ) and great tit (
              Parus major
              ) predators learn about prey defences by watching others. This shifts population preferences rapidly to match changes in prey profitability, and reduces predation pressure from na{\"\i}ve predators. Our results may help resolve how costly prey defences are maintained despite influxes of na{\"\i}ve juvenile predators, and suggest that accounting for social transmission is essential if we are to understand coevolutionary processes.},
